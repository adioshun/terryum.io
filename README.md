This repository stores markdown files of the blog posts at [TerryUm's Blog](http://terryum.io). Since my initial blog posts may not be perfect in content-wise or English-wise, I'm looking forward to your contributions to **correct my blog posts** or **translating** them into other languages.

If you have found **errata** in the post, or have **better sentences** to describe the contents in the post, please **directly modify** the makrdown files(.md) and pull a request. You can also correct **misconcepts** of the contents in the post. 

If you don't want to directly correct it, but just want to **let me know your feedbacks**, please use **Issues** section which is on the tab menu. If you leave your feedback about the post, I'll correct it by myself according to your feedback.

## 2. Translations
I'm looking forward to supporters who is willing to **translate** my posts into your language(e.g. Korean). Your tranlation will **help other people** to easily read the posts. Please **upload** your translated markdown files with the title of "OriginalTitle_LANGUAGE.md".
