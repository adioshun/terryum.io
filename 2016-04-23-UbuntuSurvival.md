# Linux?

To be honest, I'm *not* an expert of **Linux** or Linux programming. I've lived under the Windows environment for thirty years (since the MS-DOS era in 1980s) and couldn't find any reasons to move to Linux which seems like **another MS-DOS**. One of the reasons which prohibit me to move to Linux is stupid Korean websites which ignore Linux or even OSX users. (If you have to live in Korea, having Windows in your laptop is *essential* because Korea is a *Windows-dependent* world.)

# Machine learning in ~~Windows~~ Linux

However, I recently moved my research environment from Windows to **Linux** because I admitted that indepth **machine learning research** cannot be conducted on the Windows environment. In particular, most **deep learning libraries** such as [Tensorflow][TF] and [Torch] does not support Windows environment. That means, if you want to study the state-of-the-art machine learning technique which leads the revolution of today's AI technology, you cannot avoid using Linux system. I think that's [why Microsoft is brining the bash shell to Windows][MS] in this summer.

# A beginner's record of living in Ubuntu

I'm going to record my daily life living in Ubuntu as a new commer from Windows. Thus, the articles which will be posted here will be *far* from expert's tips or right answers to solve specific problems. Rather, they will be records of a Ubuntu beginner and I will share even **stupid mistakes** that can happen not only to me but also to others as well. I hope my articles would be helpful for those who start learning Ubuntu or machine learning in Ubuntu like me.
