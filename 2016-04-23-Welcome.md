Hi, I'm **_Terry (Taewoong) Um_**, a PhD candidate at **University of Waterloo**. I'm currently conducting a research on **machine leanring for human/robot motions** at [Adatptive Systems Lab][Lab] under the supervison of [Dr. *Dana Kulic*][Kulic].

Through the blog, I'd like to talk about various **machine learning** techniques and how they should be modified to be fitted for **human/robot motion** data. Moreover, I'd like to share my research experiences from miscellaneous tips to advanced topics in the hope of being helpful for the students who are interested in this field.

![It's me!][Img_Me]

To briefly introduce myself, I am a **robotics** researcher, at the same time, a **machine learning** researcher. I recieved B.S.(2008) and M.S.(2010) degrees in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Seoul National University. Under the supervison of [Dr. *Frank Park*][Park] at [SNU robotics lab][SNU], I developed a
randomized **robot motion planner** called [Tangent space RRT][TSRRT] for mobile manipulator. After graduation, I worked for developing **exoskeleton** at [LIG Nex1 Corp.][LIG] and also for developing a **transfer Learning** scheme for robots at [Korea Istitute of Science and Technology (KIST)][KIST]. Finally, I joined the department of electrical and computer engineering at [University of Waterloo][UW], Canada, in 2014 and conducting a research on **machine learning for human/robot motions**.

Find me from [facebook][facebook], [Google+][Google+], [LinkedIn][LinkedIn], [GitHub][GitHub], and [Google Scholar][Google Scholar]. You can contact me via [email][email] as well, if you have any question about my papers or codes.
