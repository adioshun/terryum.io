# I'm looking for your contributions

Or, could you give us a favor to **translate** useful blog posts into your laguage? You can directly modify and improve the posts via the [GitHub repository][GitHub]

Leave your contribution <u><b><a href="https://github.com/terryum/terryum.io">[here]</a></b></u>

# Thank you for your contributions
&nbsp;
This repository stores markdown files of the blog posts at [TerryUm's Blog](http://terryum.io). Since my initial blog posts may not be perfect in content-wise or English-wise, I'm looking forward to your contributions to **correct my blog posts** or **translating** them into other languages.

### 1. Corrections
If you have found **errata** in the post, or have **better sentences** to describe the contents in the post, please **directly modify** the makrdown files(.md) and pull a request. You can also correct **misconcepts** of the contents in the post.

If you don't want to directly correct it, but just want to **let me know your feedbacks**, please use **Issues** section which is on the tab menu. If you leave your feedback about the post, I'll correct it by myself according to your feedback.

### 2. Translations
I'm looking forward to supporters who is willing to **translate** my posts into your language(e.g. Korean). Your tranlation will **help other people** to easily read the posts. Please **upload** your translated markdown files with the title of "OriginalTitle_LANGUAGE.md".

```
e.g. "2016-04-23-Welcome.md" -> "2016-04-23-Welcome_KOR.md"
```

If your files are accepted, I'll post it on the blog with an **expression of your credit**. Also, you can post your translated post **on your own blog** for archiving. (Please just provide the link of the original source in your mirrored post.)

> *This post is tranlated in Korean in 2016-01-01 by [Terry Um](http://facebook.com/terryum)*

Please leave your contact (e.g. your facebook account) when you upload your tranlation files. (If you don't, I'll link your GitHub page to your name)

**Thank you for your contributions.**

Best regards,
Terry
